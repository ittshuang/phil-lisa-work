# Link with dropbox
Using git-remote [tool](https://github.com/anishathalye/git-remote-dropbox), this repo has a copy in Irene's dropbox folder which can be cloned to local to work on. 

To clone the repo from dropbox (after the config and setup):

```
git clone "dropbox:///github/phil-lisa-work"
```

PS. It's my first time using this method, not so familar but the basic logic of git applies.
